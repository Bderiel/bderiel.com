League of Legends Runed My Life is a full stack application that displays and explains the newly released rune system for League of Legends via a microservice API that we created. It also gives you champion data and player's recent match history by way of integrating the League of Legends API. This project was built over the course of a three-day hackathon at Fullstack Academy. My primary motivation for this project was learning how to use React Native and what difference it had to plain React. It was a noticeable change but the biggest strength is that you can make cross-platform application and keep much of the same logic especially in regards to IOS and Android.
