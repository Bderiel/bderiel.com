Genie in a Bottle was a combination of everything we learned at Fullstack Academy. It was also our first big group project. We had always pair programmed during workshops but this project was meant to simulate a work enviroment with aglie methodadalgy and all. My expeience went great. I was really lucky to randomly get excellent teamates. We organized ourselves by using a trello board and had daily stand ups for the week we took to build out the project. We also choose to pair program when every approate. I learned the importance of communication, organization, and source control. Developemnt is alot more than just coding and this project did a great of job showing me this.
