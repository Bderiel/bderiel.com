Genie in a Bottle was a combination of everything we learned at Fullstack Academy. It was also our first big group project. We had always pair programmed during workshops but this project was meant to simulate a work environment with agile methodically and all. My experience went great. I was really lucky to randomly get excellent teammates. We organized ourselves by using a trello board and had daily stand-ups for the week we took to build out the project. We also choose to pair program when every appropriate. I learned the importance of communication, organization, and source control. Development is a lot more than just coding and this project did a great job showing me this.
