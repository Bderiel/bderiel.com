This is my Capstone project for Fullstack Academy. SousAIs has two major components, the Amazon Alexa skill and the React Front-End. Built using React/Redux and Alexa SDK with an Express/Squelize microservice API that integrates Nutritionix and Spoonacular APIs. Our application allows a user to add/delete items to their fridge and create recipes based on what was available and other user decided variables. We had to build two different User Interfaces that made one cohesive experience in about a week and a half. We organized ourselves by using a trello board and had daily stand-ups to discuss our progress and goals.
