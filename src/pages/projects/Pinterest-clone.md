The last project of the FreeCodeCamp Curriclum. FreeCodeCamp is very important in my journey to becoming a Software Developer. It was one of my first resouces and would glady recommend it to anyone that wants to learn how to program.  I liked that it had a path for me to follow and could see my process. After finishing Fullstack Academy I decided to do the very last project avaible on FreeCodeCamp to see how far I had come. This project is a full stack application that allows users to share, upload, and save Pins(photos). Pins are uploaded to Amazon's S3 service. A user can make boards to save Pins and could save other user's pins in their own boards. My motiviations for this project was to learn how to use MongoDB as I had not used a NOSQL database before. I wanted to understand the nuances between a relational and non-relational database.
