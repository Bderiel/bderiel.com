It was also our first big group project. We had always pair programmed during workshops but this project was meant to simulate a work environment with agile methodically and all. My experience went great. I was really lucky to randomly get excellent teammates. We organized ourselves by using a trello board and had daily stand-ups for the week we took to build out the project. We also choose to pair program when every appropriate. I learned the importance of communication, organization, and source control. Development is a lot more than just coding and this project did a great job showing me this.  </p>",frontmatter:{date:"July 12, 2017",path:"/genie",title:"Genie in a Bottle",skills:"React,Redux,Express,Sequelize,Stripe API",images:"/images/gen1.png,/images/gen2.png,/images/gen3.png",subtitle:"E-commerce site built in NERDS stack",gitLink:"https://genie-in-a-bottle.herokuapp.com/",projectLink:"https://github.com/devondacoda/genie-in-a-bottle"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
